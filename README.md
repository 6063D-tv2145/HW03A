# HW02B Description

1. At first, I did not realize there were hints to the home work and thought I could just do two patterns. I ended up with a pattern that was too regular and quickly realized it won't work

2. Then divided the pattern into three different patterns as suggested by the assignment hints.

3. I used a for loop to create the repetition pattern for the smaller circles.
4. Then I created the larger pattern with larger spaces + added the same pattern and shifted it using the translate function.
